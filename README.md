# Panda CMS Generators

This repository contains our generators and template files used for a basic setup of Panda CMS.

## Installation Files

* `.railsrc` defaults to using Propshaft for assets, Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework, and PostgreSQL as a database. This is our standard (and most-tested) approach for running Panda CMS.
